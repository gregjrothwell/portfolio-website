## Codebase Patterns

### Testing
- Run tests after every change: `npm run test:run`
- Tests must pass before committing
- Update tests if adding new JavaScript functionality

### Styling
- Use CSS custom properties (--primary-color, --bg-tertiary, etc.)
- Follow existing responsive breakpoints: 968px, 768px, 480px
- Match animation patterns (fade-in, intersection observer)

### HTML Structure
- Sections follow pattern: .section > .container > .section-header + content
- Maintain consistent spacing (6rem padding on sections)
- Use semantic HTML (section, article, nav, etc.)

### Mobile Patterns
- Mobile menu shows on screens < 768px (matches existing breakpoint)
- Use fixed positioning with z-index layering: overlay (999), menu (1000), toggle (1001)
- Prevent body scroll when menu is open: `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'`

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented mobile navigation menu with hamburger icon
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Added slide-out navigation with smooth animations
- Implemented keyboard accessibility (ESC to close, focus management)
- Added ARIA labels to all navigation links and interactive elements
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mobile menu visibility controlled via @media (max-width: 768px)
  - Hamburger icon uses transform animations for X transition
  - Overlay + menu use separate elements for better accessibility
  - Focus management: first link gets focus when menu opens
  - All existing tests still pass (49 tests)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added comprehensive print stylesheet for clean CV printing
- Files changed: styles.css
- Implemented @media print rules with light theme colors
- Hidden all interactive elements (nav, theme toggle, footer)
- Removed animations and transitions for print
- Optimized layout for A4 with proper spacing (using cm units)
- Added page-break controls to keep related content together
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Print styles use !important to override theme variables
  - Use cm/pt units for print instead of rem/px for consistency
  - page-break-inside: avoid keeps cards together
  - External link URLs shown with ::after pseudo-elements
  - Force all backgrounds to white and text to black for readability

## [2026-01-22 00:08] - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added testimonials section with 4 testimonial cards
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css, script.js

- Implemented responsive grid layout (auto-fit, min 300px)
- Added hover effects matching achievement cards

- Updated navigation (desktop + mobile) to include testimonials
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Card layout follows existing pattern: grid with hover effects
  - Quote styling uses italic text with decorative quote mark (opacity 0.3)
  - Author section separated with border-top
  - Added to intersection observer for fade-in animations
  - Print styles keep testimonials readable in monochrome
