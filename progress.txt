## Codebase Patterns

### Testing
- Run tests after every change: `npm run test:run`
- Tests must pass before committing
- Update tests if adding new JavaScript functionality

### Styling
- Use CSS custom properties (--primary-color, --bg-tertiary, etc.)
- Follow existing responsive breakpoints: 968px, 768px, 480px
- Match animation patterns (fade-in, intersection observer)

### HTML Structure
- Sections follow pattern: .section > .container > .section-header + content
- Maintain consistent spacing (6rem padding on sections)
- Use semantic HTML (section, article, nav, etc.)

### Mobile Patterns
- Mobile menu shows on screens < 768px (matches existing breakpoint)
- Use fixed positioning with z-index layering: overlay (999), menu (1000), toggle (1001)
- Prevent body scroll when menu is open: `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'`

## [2026-01-22 00:06] - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented mobile navigation menu with hamburger icon
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Added slide-out navigation with smooth animations
- Implemented keyboard accessibility (ESC to close, focus management)
- Added ARIA labels to all navigation links and interactive elements
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mobile menu visibility controlled via @media (max-width: 768px)
  - Hamburger icon uses transform animations for X transition
  - Overlay + menu use separate elements for better accessibility
  - Focus management: first link gets focus when menu opens
  - All existing tests still pass (49 tests)

## [2026-01-22 00:07] - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added comprehensive print stylesheet for clean CV printing
- Files changed: styles.css
- Implemented @media print rules with light theme colors
- Hidden all interactive elements (nav, theme toggle, footer)
- Removed animations and transitions for print
- Optimized layout for A4 with proper spacing (using cm units)
- Added page-break controls to keep related content together
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Print styles use !important to override theme variables
  - Use cm/pt units for print instead of rem/px for consistency
  - page-break-inside: avoid keeps cards together
  - External link URLs shown with ::after pseudo-elements
  - Force all backgrounds to white and text to black for readability

## [2026-01-22 00:08] - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added testimonials section with 4 testimonial cards
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Section positioned between case-studies and philosophy as specified
- Implemented responsive grid layout (auto-fit, min 300px)
- Added hover effects matching achievement cards
- Added decorative quote marks with ::before pseudo-element
- Updated navigation (desktop + mobile) to include testimonials
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Card layout follows existing pattern: grid with hover effects
  - Quote styling uses italic text with decorative quote mark (opacity 0.3)
  - Author section separated with border-top
  - Added to intersection observer for fade-in animations
  - Print styles keep testimonials readable in monochrome

## [2026-01-22 00:10] - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added projects section after philosophy section
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Section includes 4 project cards with realistic examples
- Each card shows title, description, tech stack tags, and links/status
- Implemented responsive grid (auto-fit, min 320px)
- Hover effects match existing card patterns
- Links styled with icons (GitHub) or status indicators (Private/Internal)
- Updated navigation (desktop + mobile) to include projects
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project links use flex layout with SVG icons
  - project-status class for non-link indicators (Private Repository, Internal Tool)
  - Tech tags reuse existing .tech-tag styling from skills section
  - Card layout: title → description → tech → links (flex column with flex-grow)
  - Print styles hide links, keep content readable

## [2026-01-22 00:11] - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Improved accessibility with focus states and skip link
- Files changed: index.html, styles.css
- Added skip-to-content link (hidden until focused, top: -100px)
- Enhanced focus states for all interactive elements
- Skip link navigates to #main-content on hero section
- Focus outlines: 3px + 2px offset for buttons/links, 2px + 4px for nav
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Skip link positioned absolute with high z-index (10000)
  - Use :focus pseudo-class to show skip link (top: 0)
  - Consistent outline color using --primary-color variable
  - Heading hierarchy already correct: h1 (hero) → h2 (sections) → h3 (cards)
  - ARIA labels already complete from US-001
